Why is it so hard to do the things we want for ourselves.

## Stop setting goals, set an identity

When we think about the life we want to build we often think about a set of habits that we'd like to adopt or change.
Whether that be waking up earlier, or having less screen time.
Typically the phrasing starts like "I will/want to ...".
We build it up in our minds that the best version of ourselves is someone who follows these habits to a tee.

What I'm suggesting is to twist that phrasing slightly, "I am someone who ...", the shift now becomes about your habits as an identity and not an individual action.
The habit becomes non-negotionable, because it is part of who you are.

> "I want to be on my phone for <1hr a day"

vs.
> "I am someone who is deliberate about their phone usage".

Goals are still great. They are things we write down and check occassionally.
Our identity is something we carry with us each day.

## The only bar is consistency, not perfection

To the outside world, you haven't changed quite yet. You need to walk-the-walk so to speak. You are nothing more than what you do repeatedly.

## Start small and let momentum be your fuel for dicipline

You never hear stories about people saying, "One day I just changed all my habits and now I'm the way I am now!", it's never like that.
Drastic changes in our habits and schedule like that are overrated.

Every heard of the 1% rule? Try to be 1% better every day, and let the result compound exponentially. But how about 10% every 10 days? Do larger leaps beat daily consistency? What does better after a year?

![1% vs. 10%](/images/one-percent-vs-ten-percent.png)

```python
# 1% better daily
1.01^(365) = 37.78

# 10% better every 10 days
1.10^(365/10) = 32.42
```

Start small, and get a bit better each day. 1% of 16 hour day is just under 10 minutes. Can you be 10 minutes better than yesterday?

When you're a kid do you question if you should go to school today or not, you just get ready and go, that's just life. Over time these behaviours seem into our subconsiousness, reducing the cognitive friction that it would take before.

## Be kind to yourself

It's very important to be conscious of the way you speak to yourself. In my opinion there is no long term positive outcome for negative self-talk. Talking down or insulting yourself is the last way to make any meaningful change in your life.

Be patient, and be kind with yourself. Cheer yourself on like its you are your best friend and you'll be surprised with how far you can go.
