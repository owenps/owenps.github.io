> Sooner or later, we are bound to discover things about ourselves that we don't like. But once we see they're here, we can decide what we want to do with them.
> 
> In a similar manner, instead of struggling to erase what are referred to as negative emotions, we can describe the principle like this: while pounding on the piano keys may produce noise, removing them doesn't exactly further the creation of music.

Try to picture a rock sitting in the middle of a stream. The water doesn't try to force its way through the rock, but rather accepts its presence and gracefully glides around it.

Taoism argues that every object in the universe has a concept of inner nature and harmony. Bringing an object out of its natural flow will easily spoil that state. Taoism embodies being one with your inner nature and the harmony of the world around you.

In "The Tao of Pooh", Benjamin Hoff provides a introduction to Taoism through the claim that Winnie-the-Pooh is the personification of various taoist principles.

### Uncarved Block

Sometimes referred to as "wood not cut" is the Taoist principle living life in an unforced manner.

> From the state of the Uncarved Block comes the ability to enjoy the simple and plain. Along with that comes the ability todo things spontaneously and have them work, odd as that may appear at times...
> 
> When you discard arrogance, complexity, and a few other things that get in the way, sooner or later you will discover that simple childlike, and mysterious secret known to those of the Uncarved Block: Life is Fun.

Pooh is considered the epitome of the "uncarved block". As he lives his life as simple as possible. He lives by the natural flow of how things are, he just "is".

We all have innate qualities about ourselves, you may see them as a negative but under the right circumstances, it could be positive.

How do you view a tree with a crooked trunk? Do you view it as a failure because it is not tall with great big branches? Or do you see it as a great place to climb and sit in the shade?

### Analysis vs. Awareness

Two men are sitting on a porch: a scholar and a taoist. The scholar hears the birds chirping and thinks *"what kinds of birds are chirping?"*, whereas the Taoist hears the birds and thinks, *"wow, how lovely to hear the birds chirping!"*. 

### Nowhere and Nothing

Taoism (and Winnie-the-Pooh) describe the "Great Secret", is nothing. The book argues that the best ideas come closer from a state of a clear mind. That is, if an idea comes from a sequence of thoughts the better the idea, the shorter the sequence. Where one end is the idea itself and the other is of a mind of emptiness.

> In the middle of nothing, I join the source of all things.

Reminds me of a conversation from [Burning (2018)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_(2018_film)) on the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in Africa.

They say there are two kinds of starving people in the world, one with "Little Hunger" - physically hungry people. The other is "Great Hunger", those who desire to find meaning to something bigger than themselves. Those individuals are seen as 'truly hungry'.

It seems as though Taoism is suggesting that the antidote to great hunger is through the great secret: nothing.

It seems a bit too simple for those searching for deep meaning in their life. How do you prescribe nothing to somone struggling with great hunger?

But what do you see when you meet someone who is truly fulfilled, enlightened if you will. It is the enjoyment and appreciatation of the everday and the simple moments between every breath. It is that just like the kind-of nothing Taoism prescribes?
