### **50s** - 12 Angry Men (1957)

12 Angry Men is a ourtroom drama full of hall-of-fame performances and sudden twists. The story is about a twelve male jury members who must come to a consensus regarding the death sentence to a 16 year old boy.

The movie takes place in one room. From the moment they enter, you get a chance to learn about each individual jury member and how it influences their decision of whether this boy is guilty or innocent.

As the movie progresses and the evidence is laid out, as a viewer, you feel like the thirteenth jury member as you try to solve the case yourself. 12 Angry Men is a theatrical masterpiece that will have you captive from the very beginning.

### **60s** - 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)
2001: A Space Odyssey is perhaps the most unique film on this short list. The film was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke’s short story “The Sentinel”. The plot surrounds a mysterious artifact that is buried beneath the lunar surface and mankind’s quest to find its origins. 

The film introduces a super computer H.A.L 9000 whose capabilities were based off the predictions/speculations of respected scientist . 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the first major films to explore general artificial intelligence and computational rationalization and reasoning.

With hardly any dialog, the film lets the music and visuals do all the talking. There really isn’t much I can say that will prepare you for the rollercoaster that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film will leave you speechless, perplexed, and mesmerized. It will be one you remember for the rest of your life, I count on it.

### **70s** - The God Father Part I (1972)
The God Father Part I belongs to the historic movie trilogy adapted from the fiction novel by Mario Puzo. The story covers the trials and tribulations of the infamous Corleone mafia family. The first film focuses on Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), the head of the family and his youngest son Michael (Al Pachino) who is reluctant to follow in his footsteps.

The story is beautifully crafted and executed with extreme precision. All the intricacies and subtleties makes the film one you’ll revisit again. The three hour time stamp for the first film alone is daring, but not a second is wasted. While the third film falls short of the expectations set by the previous two, The God Father trilogy is unparalleled, and it’s on a completely different level of all other crime/dramas out there. For the rest of human history the God Father Part I will be regarded as one of the most influential crime/drams every created.

### **80s** - The Blues Brothers (1980)
To pivot into a completely different genre. The Blues Brothers is a musical comedy unlike any other. 

After released from prison Jake (John Belushi) reunites with his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). The two embark on a wild goose chase to bring their old band back together in order to raise $5,000 dollars to save their childhood orphanage from closing. 

What is so special about the Blues Brothers is that everything Jake and Elwood do plays precedence throughout the film. Each of their actions dictate the next, all organically contributing to the overarching plot. You can’t help but laugh and smile as each scene exponentially becomes more hilariously ridiculous.

The musical numbers are always appropriately placed to break up the major events and are executed nearly perfectly. Watching these scenes never felt like a chore which is known to be a big issue in this genre. 

If you’re not in the mood for drama and want something a little more silly and light hearted, I can’t recommend a better movie from the 80s.

### **90s** - The Shawshank Redemption (1994) 

The Shawshank Redemption is widely regarded as one of the most well received movies ever. As the number one ranked movie on IMDB, you’ve likely heard about this movie at one point or another. The story is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a successful banker who is arrested for the murder of his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. 

The film is perfectly casted as every lead and supporting role puts on a phenomenal performance. In just under two and a half hours, the film paints an incredibly rich, immersive, and captivating experience. There isn’t much that can be said without giving too much away. The unexpected twists and turns from beginning to end along with the incredible story telling and acting makes The Shawshank Redemption a must watch for all movie lovers.

### **00s** - Inglourious Basterds (2009)

<img src="blog/seven_must_see_movies/inglourious-basterds.jpg" alt="Inglourious Basterds" width="100%"></img>

I don’t think I could ever make one of these lists without a Tarantino film. Inglourious Basterds tells two stories: a group of Jewish soldiers who are on a mission to take down the Nazi government and a woman seeking the revenge of her family’s death by a German Officier. 

With one the coldest villains every played by Christoph Waltz, Inglourious Basterds is one of the few movies that will have you crying laughing and paralyzed by tension. The film takes a common plot line and approaches it from an angle unlike none other. Tarantino created a master piece supported by an absolutely stacked cast featuring the likes of Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Daniel Bruhl, and much more.

### **10s** - The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)

Perhaps one of the most beautiful movies I’ve ever seen in The Grand Budapest Hotel. The film surrounds Mr.Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) who is a concierge wrongly framed for the murder of one of his guests at the Grand Budapest Hotel. The plot is told through the eyes of a writer who interviews a former lobby boy of the hotel. 

<img src="blog/seven_must_see_movies/the-grand-budapest-hotel.jpg" alt="Grand Budapest Hotel" width="100%"></img>

Absolutely everything from the costumes to the music in the Grand Budapest is nothing short of spectacular. I often describe it to others as eye candy. The film won four an academy awards and a golden globe for the year’s best picture. In my eyes, despite all these awards, it is often underestimated as one of the best films of this decade.
