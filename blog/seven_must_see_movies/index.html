The movie takes place in one room. From the moment they enter, you get a chance to learn about each individual jury member and how it influences their decision of whether this boy is guilty or innocent.

As the movie progresses and the evidence is laid out, as a viewer, you feel like the thirteenth jury member as you try to solve the case yourself. 12 Angry Men is a theatrical masterpiece that will have you captive from the very beginning.

### **60s** - 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)
2001: A Space Odyssey is perhaps the most unique film on this short list. The film was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke’s short story “The Sentinel”. The plot surrounds a mysterious artifact that is buried beneath the lunar surface and mankind’s quest to find its origins. 

The film introduces a super computer H.A.L 9000 whose capabilities were based off the predictions/speculations of respected scientist . 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the first major films to explore general artificial intelligence and computational rationalization and reasoning.

With hardly any dialog, the film lets the music and visuals do all the talking. There really isn’t much I can say that will prepare you for the rollercoaster that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film will leave you speechless, perplexed, and mesmerized. It will be one you remember for the rest of your life, I count on it.

### **70s** - The God Father Part I (1972)
The God Father Part 1 belongs to the historic movie trilogy adapted from the fiction novel by Mario Puzo. The story covers the trials and tribulations of the infamous Corleone mafia family. The first film focuses on Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), the head of the family and his youngest son Michael (Al Pachino) who is reluctant to follow in his footsteps.

The story is beautifully crafted and executed with extreme precision. All the intricacies and subtleties makes the film one you’ll revisit again. The three hour time stamp for the first film alone is daring, but not a second is wasted. While the third film falls short of the expectations set by the previous two, The God Father trilogy is unparalleled, and it’s on a completely different level of all other crime/dramas out there. For the rest of human history the God Father Part I will be regarded as one of the most influential crime/drams every created.

### **80s** - The Blues Brothers (1980)
To pivot into a completely different genre. The Blues Brothers (1980) is a musical comedy unlike any other. 

After released from prison Jake (John Belushi) reunites with his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd). The two embark on a wild goose chase to bring their old band back together in order to raise $5,000 dollars to save their childhood orphanage from closing. 

What is so special about the Blues Brothers is that everything Jake and Elwood do plays precedence throughout the film. Each of their actions dictate the next, all organically contributing to the overarching plot. You can’t help but laugh and smile as each scene exponentially becomes more hilariously ridiculous.

The musical numbers are always appropriately placed to break up the major events and are executed nearly perfectly. Watching these scenes never felt like a chore which is known to be a big issue in this genre. 

If you’re not in the mood for drama and want something a little more silly and light hearted, I can’t recommend a better movie from the 80s.
