The movie takes place in one room. From the moment they enter, you get a chance to learn about each individual jury member and how it influences their decision of whether this boy is guilty or innocent. 

As the movie progresses and the evidence is laid out, as a viewer, you feel like the thirteenth jury member as you try to solve the case yourself. 12 Angry Men is a theatrical masterpiece that will have you captive from the very beginning.

## **60s** - 2001: A Space Odyssey
2001: A Space Odyssey is perhaps the most unique film on this short list. The film was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke’s short story “The Sentinel”. The plot surrounds a mysterious artifact that is buried beneath the lunar surface and mankind’s quest to find its origins. 

The film introduces a super computer H.A.L 9000 whose capabilities were based off the predictions/speculations of respected scientist . 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the first major films to explore general artificial intelligence and computational rationalization and reasoning.

With hardly any dialog, the film lets the music and visuals do all the talking. There really isn’t much I can say that will prepare you for the rollercoaster that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film will leave you speechless, perplexed, and mesmerized. It will be one you remember for the rest of your life, I count on it.
